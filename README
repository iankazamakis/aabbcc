Let’s break down the satellite-to-satellite access generation algorithm in simple terms, focusing on how it works and what it’s doing, especially since you’re adapting a ground-to-satellite access algorithm to handle satellite-to-satellite visibility.
What’s the Goal?
The algorithm determines when two satellites can "see" each other over a given time period. Two satellites can see each other if:

The Earth isn’t blocking the line of sight between them (no occultation).
They’re not too far apart (within a maximum visible distance, defined in the config).
Unlike ground-to-satellite access, which relies on "rise" and "set" events (when a satellite appears above or drops below the horizon), satellite-to-satellite access needs a different approach because satellites in similar orbits (e.g., following each other) might always have a clear line of sight without these horizon events.

How It Works (High-Level)
The algorithm:

Checks Visibility Over Time: It figures out periods when one satellite can see another by checking if the Earth is in the way or if they’re too far apart.
Finds Start and End Times: It identifies when visibility begins and ends (transitions between visible and not visible).
Handles Additional Filters: It applies constraints like illumination (is the target satellite sunlit?) and optionally calculates access points (details like range and angles at specific times).
Is Efficient: It avoids checking every tiny time step by using a smart search method to find key transition points.

Step-by-Step Rundown
Here’s how the code operates, simplified:
1. Setup

Inputs: You provide the target satellite (sat), the observer (another satellite or ground station, stored in gs), a time window (start to end), and a configuration (cfg) with settings like minimum elevation angle or maximum visible distance.
Observer Type: The algorithm checks if gs is a ground station or a satellite. If it’s a ground station, it uses the original ground-to-satellite logic (finding rise/set events). If it’s a satellite, it switches to the new satellite-to-satellite logic.
Time Periods: If you care about day/night (e.g., for ground stations), it splits the time window into night periods. For satellite-to-satellite, it might skip this or use eclipse periods, but the example assumes the full time window for simplicity.

2. Ground vs. Satellite Logic

Ground-to-Satellite (Original Logic):

Uses Skyfield’s find_events to detect when the satellite rises above or sets below the horizon (based on a minimum elevation angle, like 10 degrees).
These events mark the start and end of access periods when the satellite is visible from the ground.
It then filters these periods based on constraints like illumination (is the satellite sunlit?) or sensor pointing limits (azimuth/elevation ranges or fan geometry).


Satellite-to-Satellite (New Logic):

Since there’s no horizon for satellites, it can’t rely on rise/set events.
Instead, it checks visibility by calculating if:

The Earth blocks the line of sight (occultation).
The satellites are within the maximum visible distance (e.g., 10,000 km).


It uses a mathematical check to determine visibility at different times, avoiding brute-force checks every 0.5 seconds.



3. Visibility Check (Satellite-to-Satellite)
The core of the new logic is the visibility_func, which determines if the satellites can see each other at a given time:

Positions: It gets the 3D positions (in kilometers) of both satellites using Skyfield’s at method.
Distance: Calculates the distance between them (|d|).
Occultation Check:

Computes the closest approach of the line between the satellites to the Earth’s center using vector math (dot products and cross products).
If this distance is less than Earth’s radius (about 6,371 km) and the closest point lies between the satellites, the Earth is blocking the line of sight (occultation).


Max Distance: Checks if the distance between satellites is less than or equal to the maximum allowed (from cfg.max_visible_distance_meters).
Result: Returns 1.0 (visible) if there’s no occultation and the satellites are close enough, or 0.0 (not visible) otherwise.

4. Finding Visibility Transitions

Uses Skyfield’s find_discrete to efficiently find times when visibility changes (from visible to not visible or vice versa).
It steps through time (e.g., every 30 seconds) and evaluates visibility_func.
When the function switches from 0.0 to 1.0 or 1.0 to 0.0, it records these as transition times.
These transitions define the start and end of access periods (e.g., a period starts when the satellites become visible and ends when they’re occulted or too far).

5. Building Accesses

Creates Access objects for each visibility period, storing:

The target satellite (sat).
The observer (the other satellite).
Start and end times of the access.
A unique ID (uuid).


Optionally finds the culmination (the time of closest approach during the access) by searching for the minimum distance between satellites using Skyfield’s find_maxima on the negative distance function.

6. Filtering

Illumination: If configured (cfg.accesses_calculate_sunlit_accesses), it checks if the target satellite is sunlit during the access period and splits or filters accesses accordingly (using calculate_sunlit_periods and adjust_access_for_illumination).
Sensor Constraints: For ground stations, it applies azimuth, elevation, or fan geometry filters. For satellite-to-satellite, it skips these since the example assumes 360-degree visibility (no sensor pointing limits).
The result is a list of filtered accesses that meet all constraints.

7. Access Points

For each access, it generates AccessPoint objects (using create_access_points), which include details like the time, azimuth, elevation, and range at specific points during the access. For satellite-to-satellite, this might need tweaking to compute angles relative to the observer satellite’s frame.

Key Features

Efficiency: Instead of checking every 0.5 seconds, it uses find_discrete to jump to transition points, reducing computations. The step size (e.g., 30 seconds) balances accuracy and speed.
Occultation: Uses vector geometry to check if the Earth blocks the line of sight, avoiding brute-force ray tracing.
Max Distance: Incorporates a maximum visible distance to handle cases where satellites are too far apart to communicate.
Flexibility: Reuses much of the ground-to-satellite code, with a branch for satellite-to-satellite logic, making it maintainable.
Skyfield: Leverages Skyfield for accurate orbital propagation and time handling, ensuring robust calculations.

Example Scenario
Imagine two satellites, Sat1 and Sat2, orbiting Earth:

Time Window: 1 hour (e.g., 12:00 to 13:00).
Max Distance: 10,000 km.
At 12:00, Sat1 and Sat2 are 5,000 km apart with a clear line of sight (no Earth in the way). They’re visible.
At 12:15, the Earth moves into the line of sight (occultation). Visibility ends.
At 12:30, they emerge from behind the Earth, and visibility resumes until 12:45 when they’re 12,000 km apart (beyond max distance).
The algorithm outputs two accesses: 12:00–12:15 and 12:30–12:45, with culmination times (closest approach) calculated.

Assumptions and Notes

The code assumes 360-degree visibility for satellite-to-satellite (no sensor pointing limits), as specified.
You need to define how the observer satellite is created from gs (e.g., using TLE data).
The create_access_points function may need adaptation to compute azimuth/elevation for satellite-to-satellite (relative to the observer’s velocity or body frame).
The step size (30 seconds) can be adjusted for accuracy vs. performance.
Some helper functions (e.g., calculate_sunlit_periods) are assumed to exist from your original code.

Why It’s Efficient

Avoids Brute Force: Instead of checking every 0.5 seconds, it uses find_discrete to find visibility changes, typically requiring far fewer evaluations.
Vector Math: The occultation check uses simple dot and cross products, which are fast even for arrays of times.
Reuses Code: Shares filtering logic with ground-to-satellite, reducing code duplication.
